# RansacSolver
My own implementation of the RANSAC algorithm using the fitting model LineModelND

This repo contains two  python files, each containing a class to generate points and use a ransac solver (respectively) to fit a line across the points. 

The implementation of these lasses can be found in the Jupyter Notebook along with a visualization of the points and line fitting.
